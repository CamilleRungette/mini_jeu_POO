## App.rb 
A fighting game with two players; the script runs automatically until one of th players is out of life points.

## App2.rb
An interactive fighting game; you, against two villains. They each have 10 life points, you have 100 AND a level 1 weapon.
Every round, you have to make a choice:
- looking for a better weapon
- looking for life points
- attacking player 1
- attacking player 2

The two other players will attack you after you player. The game runs until you beat the two players, or until one of them beats you
